[Neuroglancer](https://github.com/google/neuroglancer) is an amazing tool for browsing complex 3-dimensional data, and it offers fantastically accessible state representations in both python and JSON-formatted URLs. This package provides a number of helper functions for many basic interactions with a neuroglancer instance or a neuroglancer state. This is useful for doing things like quickly adding an annotation layer or getting numpy arrays into and out of neuroglancer views.
